# Shipra: My Virtual Assistant

A simple, browser-based virtual assistant that responds to voice commands. This project is built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core web development skills.

## üöÄ Features

- **Voice-Activated Greeting**: The assistant welcomes the user with a time-based greeting when the page is clicked for the first time.
- **Intelligent Command Recognition**: Recognizes and responds to a variety of voice commands, including greetings, inquiries about itself, and specific actions.
- **Opens Websites**: Can open popular websites like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn on command.
- **System Utility**: Can open the system's calculator and WhatsApp applications.
- **Time and Date**: Provides the current time and date in a spoken response.
- **Dynamic Search**: If a command is not recognized, the assistant performs a Google search for the query, ensuring a useful response every time.
- **Clean UI**: Features a sleek, minimalist user interface with a voice animation that indicates when the assistant is listening.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the project's structure and content.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating the clean user interface.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: The core logic, built without external frameworks or libraries, to handle all interactive features.
- **Web Speech API**: Powers the voice recognition and text-to-speech functionality.
